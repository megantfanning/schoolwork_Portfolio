    Widget builder (https://business.pinterest.com/en/widget-builder#do_pin_it_button) may be the most important tool in
    your toolkit for making your web page Pinterest friendly.<br>
    The widget Builder provides a snippet of HTML and JavaScript code which you can paste directly into your website.
    The widget builder will make: the pin it button, the follow me on Pinterest button, a pin widget, a board widget and
    a profile widget.<br>
    The widget builder generates some code that looks like this (Example of a embedded Pinterest board)
    <br>(note: square brackets are shown here for demonstration purposes, in your website angled brackets will be used)
    <div class="code">
        <ol>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; <li>[a data-pin-do="embedBoard" href="https://www.pinterest.com/Mzlovely88/new-orleans/"data-pin-scale-width="80"data-pin-scale-height="200" data-pin-board-width="400"]</li>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; <li> Follow New Orleans on Pinterest.[/a]</li>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; <li> [!-- Please call pinit.js only once per page --]</li>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; <li> [script type="text/javascript" async src="//assets.pinterest.com/js/pinit.js"][/script]</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    Let's break down the first three lines of code (which is one function call).<br>
    It calls a function ([a data-pin-do="embedBoard" data-pin-do) using the assets made available from line 4.<br>
    Next it calls the board that will be displayed (href="https://www.pinterest.com/userName/board-name/).<br>
    The final section of the first line of code sets the size of the widget (data-pin-scale-width="80"data-pin-scale-height="200" data-pin-board-width="400").<br>
    Line three displays the alt text.<br>
    Line 4 and 5 tell you to call the Pinterest assets once per a page. If you will be displaying multiple boards or pin
    objects you can add this last line to the bottom of your HTML code (just before the closing body tag) and then delete it from all subsequently generated widgets.
    Another way to generate a widget is once you've created a board you can generate embedded board for your website by
    going to the top right hand side of the board and clicking the button with three dots and selecting “make a widget”
    this will provide you with a snippet of JavaScript which can be pasted into a web page.

    <a name="widgetTypes"> <h2 style="color:#bd081c;">Types of Widgets and Pin Makers</h2> </a>
        <p>
            The widget maker makes: Board Widgets, Profile widget, pin widget, pin it button and follow button. Each of
            these have different potential uses.
            The board widget is best suited to displaying a board that is themed around your article, recipe or idea.
            The profile widget is a good fit for allowing people to easily follow your brand, alternatively the follow
            button is also well suited to this purpose. The Pin widget is good for when you want people to save your specific
            image as a pin for example a product or key graphic. The pin it button is the Swiss army knife of these options,
            it's great because it's very versatile you can create pin it buttons for : your entire web page, that show how
            many people have saved this pin, that hover over images, that save one specific image etc.

            <!--PIN IT BUTTON FOR ANYTHING ON PAGE-->
            <a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/" data-pin-do="buttonBookmark"  data-pin-color="red" data-pin-height="28">
                <img src="//assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_red_28.png" /></a>
            This button will pin any image on this website
            <br>

            <!-- Rose PIN IT BUTTON-->
            This button will pin only the picture of the roses, not any of the other images.
            <a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flickr.com%2Fphotos%2F9966270%40N02%2F8403052279&media=https%3A%2F%2Fc1.staticflickr.com%2F9%2F8330%2F8403052279_46b84b958c_n.jpg&description=Roses%20are%20Red" data-pin-do="buttonPin" data-pin-config="beside" data-pin-color="red" data-pin-height="28">

            <br>
            A few notes on the hover pin it button. A few kinds of images won't work with the hover pin it button.
            Specifically CSS background images, images that are under 80 by 80 pixels in size, and images whose src attribute
            starts with data: won't show hover buttons. If you don't want images to have a hover pin it you can set
            the data-pin-no-hover="true" attribute set, or the nopin="nopin" attribute.
            To disable the hover over pin it button for the whole website use the meta tag no hover in the header of the website.
        </p>
    Like so
    <div class="code" >
        [meta name="pinterest" content="nohover"][/meta]<br>
        OR<br>
        [meta name="pinterest" content="nopin"][/meta]
    </div>
    <br>
    Pinning will still be possible, but the browser extension will not show hover buttons.
