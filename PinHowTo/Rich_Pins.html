            Rich Pins are pins which contain meta data which will be displayed on Pinterest.
            There are several kinds of supported rich tags: Product, Recipe, Movie, Article and Place.
            All rich tags will have meta data which will be included in the header of your HTML page.
            Rich tags use Schema.org tags which enable search engines to use your meta data.
            Additionally specific tagging types of tags are used for some rich tags: Open Graph Tags (Articles and Places)
            and oEmbed (products).
            Tagging provides context to search engines and create types of 'items' and 'places' with properties that make it
            unique. This meta data helps search engines narrow searches so that what a user puts in something which could
            have multiple meanings ( for example “Sherlock”: TV series, character, book, adagio tea blend or IOS search engine?).
            Schema.org can be understood by the major search engines: Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo!
            To enable rich pins for your website you need to apply via the rich pin validator (https://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/validator/). Usually it takes a week or so for rich pins to be enabled.
